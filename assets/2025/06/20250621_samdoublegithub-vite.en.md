It had been a few weeks since I wanted to transition from Create React App, officially obsolete for a few months now, to Vite. The project was starting to accumulate security vulnerabilities for which there was no other solution than to revert to a 5-6 year old version of CRA.

I also took the opportunity to upgrade from React 18 to 19. It was very easy by following [the official documentation]((https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide)). They even provide scripts ("codemods") to automatically make some changes in the code. The modifications were minor.

To move from CRA to Vite, following the steps in [this Medium article]((https://adhithiravi.medium.com/migrating-from-create-react-app-to-vite-a-modern-approach-76148adb8983)) helped me a lot. With that, I completed 80% of what needed to be done for the migration. The remaining 20% was about repairing the fetching of the Markdown files that make up the blog posts. To get that working again, I had to move the Markdown files from the `src` folder to the `public/assets` folder. In the end, it's for the best: the articles are content, not source code. And as a bonus, they're now side by side with the images they contain instead of being in two completely separate folders.
