In the second cycle of Tramp, Yann Calec investigates the murder of Captain Bernard Avron, a despicable man that everyone on the ship could have wanted to kill. On the evening of Avron's disappearance, Calec himself had fought with the captain and had given him a blow that knocked him out. Calec knows that when he left him, the captain was unconscious but alive. But then how did he end up dead at the bottom of the ocean?

Like the first cycle of the series, this one is very well done. This time, it's a classic "whodunit" where the killer has to be one of the crew members. As for the artwork, it's overall good, although the facial expressions are sometimes a bit rough compared to the backgrounds and inanimate objects.
