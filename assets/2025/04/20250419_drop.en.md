Violet is a single mother who has just started dating again. One evening, she leaves her 10-year old son with her sister to go on a first date with Henry, a man she's been chatting with for several weeks. They meet at The Palate, an upscale restaurant on the top floor of a high-rise building.
Everything goes well until Violet starts receiving "drops" - anonymous messages from someone within a 15-meter radius. The mysterious person quickly makes it clear to Violet that her son and sister are being held hostage at her home and will be killed unless she does everything she's told. The messages must be coming from somewhere in the restaurant, but between the man she's collided with twice, the bold pianist, the weird waiter, the man on the blind date, the bartender, and Henry, Violet has no shortage of suspects.

During the movie, I suspected everyone one after another, and I couldn't figure out who might be sending the messages. I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Well, until about 10 minutes before the end. Once Violet identified the culprit, the action scenes were a bit far-fetched and predictable.  
It reminded me a lot of Non-Stop, but with enough different or new elements to avoid being a carbon copy. I really enjoyed it, and in my opinion, it deserves better than its 6.5 score on IMDb.
