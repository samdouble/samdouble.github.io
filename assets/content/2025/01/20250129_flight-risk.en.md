This is the third time in a week and a half that I've gone to the movies. There were several films that tempted me, but I must say that so far, I've been underwhelmed. September 5 was good, but not the action movie I had hoped for. The Brutalist was decent too, but way too long for not much substance.

Flight Risk was promising. I like Mark Wahlberg's movies, and the premise was interesting: in an isolated village in Alaska, federal agent Harris must transport Winston, a key witness for the Moretti mob trial, to Seattle. They take a chartered flight but quickly realize that the pilot isn't who he claims to be. He's a maniac hired by Moretti to get rid of Winston.

To enjoy this movie, you need to turn off your brain and ask for nothing more than action and suspense held together by a shaky plot. The dialogues made me roll my eyes several times. I wonder if it was written by artificial intelligence because some lines seemed to be there just to add humor, but I have trouble imagining anyone other than Alexa laughing at them. Winston is an unbearable character. I was glad when Mark Wahlberg stabbed him and agent Harris had to inject him with morphine: he finally stopped talking.

At one point, agent Harris, who has regained control of the plane that neither she nor the witness knows how to fly, manages to call for help on her satellite phone and talk to a pilot, Hassan. For at least a minute, instead of giving her instructions, he tells her how they're going to have dinner together that evening and how she'll buy him lots of wine bottles to thank him for getting her out of this mess. To this, she reacts like any normal person in a life-or-death situation: she laughs and appreciates being hit on by a stranger she's never met, while she's at the controls of a plane she doesn't know how to fly, heading in the wrong direction in the middle of the mountains, with a psycho on board who just tried to kill her. Is she heading to Anchorage, Siberia, or Santa's Village? Who cares, there's Hassan who wants her to buy him dinner.

The suspense was forced and the action far-fetched.  
The single-engine plane plows propeller-first into a snowbank on a mountainside and passes through without issue while maintaining its trajectory, yet during the approach, deviates 45 degrees from the runway due to some crosswinds.  
In another scene, Agent Harris didn't get hit by point-blank gunshots, while she was protected only by the pilot's seat.  
This constant cycle where Mark Wahlberg is tied up but manages to break free, attack Harris and Winston for 2 minutes, before they regain control and tie him up again became tiresome.  
Agent Harris deciding to go against Hassan's suggestions during landing: "NO I ABSOLUTELY MUST ATTEMPT THIS LANDING IN THE MOST DIFFICULT CONDITIONS POSSIBLE OTHERWISE ~~THE VIEWERS WON'T BE ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS~~ WINSTON WILL DIE FROM 2 KNIFE WOUNDS IN THE SHOULDER!!!"... please!

The Rocky Mountain landscapes in Alaska were very beautiful. Unfortunately, I came for the story, and it didn't hold up well enough. I had a good time, but there are too many better action movies for me to ever watch this one again.
