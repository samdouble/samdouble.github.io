In the second installment of the Reacher series, he and Holly Johnson, a stranger on crutches whom he was helping at the laundromat, are taken hostage by members of an extremist militia. They are taken from Chicago to a remote compound deep in a Montana forest. While Reacher was unlucky, Holly wasn't chosen at random: she is an FBI agent, but more importantly, the daughter of the United States Army's general. While Holly's colleagues and father try to find her, Reacher and Holly attempt to escape from the brutal and bloodthirsty group holding them captive.

The book was good, but less than the first one. The plot, action, characters... everything was a notch below Killing Floor. Character development was almost non-existent compared to that of Roscoe and Finlay. As a result, the relationship Reacher developed with Holly wasn't even close to the one he developed with Roscoe. At the end, when they parted ways, he didn't really seem to care, and neither did I.  
The third-person narration made it harder to access Reacher's thoughts. The description of action scenes became more spectacular than factual. It was no longer Reacher describing what was happening, but the author narrating how brilliantly Reacher dominates his opponents.

I liked the FBI mole subplot. Objectively, it's a good book, but one that should not be compared to Killing Floor in order to be better enjoyed.
