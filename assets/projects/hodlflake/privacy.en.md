**Last Updated: September 16th, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Hodlflake (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Snowflake Native App. By installing or using Hodlflake through the Snowflake Marketplace, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.

#### 1. Information We Collect

Hodlflake itself does **not collect, process, or store any personal data**. All cryptocurrency data provided is publicly available market and historical data.

However, in connection with the Snowflake Marketplace:

- **Account Information**: Snowflake may provide us with limited metadata (such as account ID or organization ID) necessary to provision access.
- **Usage Data**: We may receive anonymized or aggregated data regarding the usage of Hodlflake (e.g., frequency of queries, subscription status).

We do not collect or store sensitive personal information.

#### 2. How We Use Information

We may use the limited information we receive to:

- Provide and maintain access to Hodlflake.
- Improve performance and functionality.
- Monitor for misuse or violations of the Terms of Service.
- Comply with legal or regulatory obligations.

#### 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or trade user data. Information may only be shared:

- **With Snowflake**: To enable billing, provisioning, and compliance with marketplace requirements.
- **For Legal Reasons**: If required by applicable law, regulation, or valid legal process.
- **With Service Providers**: In rare cases, with trusted providers supporting the application’s operation, subject to confidentiality obligations.

#### 4. Data Retention

We retain only the minimal data required for access management and compliance. No personal data is permanently stored within Hodlflake.

If you terminate your subscription, any associated account metadata will be removed or anonymized within a reasonable timeframe.

#### 5. Security

We take reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Use of Hodlflake is at your own risk.

#### 6. Third-Party Services

Hodlflake runs entirely within the Snowflake Data Cloud. Your use of Hodlflake is also governed by Snowflake’s own terms and privacy policies, which we do not control. Please review Snowflake’s policies for additional information.

#### 7. Children’s Privacy

Hodlflake is not intended for individuals under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

#### 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be effective immediately upon posting. Continued use of Hodlflake constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
