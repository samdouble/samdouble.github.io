This post is a recap of my MTLàTABLE 2024 experience. This is the year where I tried the most restaurants, with 5. Since they were all in the same price range ($50), it's quite easy to compare them directly based on the quality of the meal and service.

#### #1 Caribou Gourmand

**4 courses, weekday evening**  
Of the 5 restaurants, this was the best compromise between food quantity and culinary discoveries. The menu was original and showcased Québec products. Like last year, I was able to discover meats I had never eaten before. This year, it was red deer and seal. I left Caribou Gourmand with a full stomach, feeling like I got an excellent meal for my money.

#### #2 Pub Cartier Arms

**4 courses, weekend evening**  
In second place, Pub Cartier Arms in Old Montréal. Great atmosphere with the view of Place Gare Viger and good service. I would have liked the main course (duck confit) to be a bit larger, but overall, I enjoyed each of the 4 courses.

#### #3 June Buvette

**4 courses, weekend evening**  
In the middle of the pack is June Buvette. It seems like a somewhat unfair position given the quality of the meal I had there, but it's more reflective of my satisfaction with Caribou Gourmand and Pub Cartier Arms than anything else. In reality, the only negative point about my evening at June Buvette was that I was still a bit hungry when leaving. However, everything I ate was delicious, and being seated directly at the bar, I enjoyed excellent service (which I probably would have had sitting anywhere else, anyway).

#### #4 Greasy Spoon

**3 courses, weekend evening**  
I had a good meal at Greasy Spoon. The service was impeccable, and I ate well. My main criticism is the lack of originality in the menu and the fact that I probably could have eaten the same thing for the same price outside of MTLàTABLE, while the event specifically aims to allow people to discover restaurants at lower prices than during the rest of the year.

#### #5 Jacopo

**3 courses, weekend evening**  
Like Greasy Spoon, I felt I could have eaten what I had at Jacopo for the same price at any other time of the year, which is unfortunate. Add to that the fairly high expectations I had knowing it was ranked #5 out of nearly 7,000 restaurants in Montréal on TripAdvisor. At the same time, on TripAdvisor, these are mainly tourist reviews, so it's easy to imagine that the ranking is favorably biased towards restaurants located in the Old Port.

The food itself was good, but I expected more for $50 at MTLàTABLE. The service was decent, although the wait for the main course was too long and stood out from the rest of my experience at the event. Jacopo was the last of the 5 restaurants I did this year, and across all services at the 4 previous ones, I couldn't remember having to wait more than 20-25 minutes for a dish. In short, I'm glad I tried Jacopo, but I prefer to leave it to travelers from around the world, who will appreciate it better than I did.

#### Conclusion

I think for next year, unless I choose a restaurant in a lower price range (e.g., $35), I'll stick to those offering a minimum of 4 courses. I found they offered better value for the price and their menus were generally more refined.
