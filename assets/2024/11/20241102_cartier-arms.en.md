For the third day of MTLàTABLE, I decided to try another restaurant in the $50 category, the Cartier Arms Pub, located in the Hyatt Centric hotel, near the Clock Tower. To get there on foot, I had to take numerous detours and alternative streets because there was a lot of construction in the area.

I finally arrived at the Hyatt Centric, 10 minutes late for my reservation.

Still outside, to the left of the restaurant when facing the hotel, there was a staircase that led down to a large courtyard.

Little did I know, when entering Pub Cartier Arms, that I would be seated right next to the huge window overlooking this courtyard. As the server told me, the building in the distance is Place Gare Viger, which houses, among other things, the offices of Lightspeed.

The restaurant was essentially empty, but my table was next to a couple in their 60s.

The photo below doesn't do the place justice. It was brighter than shown here and the ambient light was more pink than orange.

For the appetizer, I had the burrata with cherry tomato stew. It was good. I found there was a lot of burrata compared to the other elements on the plate, which meant I often had to take bites where there wasn't much else besides burrata.

Before the main course, there was a citrus granita. It was a kind of small sorbet, with a mint leaf on top.

For the main course, it was a Lac Brome duck leg confit. It was excellent, and I wished there had been more.

For dessert, it was an apple and caramel crumble with vanilla ice cream and fleur de sel caramel. The vanilla ice cream was standard, but the apple-caramel combination was very flavorful. This type of dessert often tends to be bland, but in this case, not at all.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Pub Cartier Arms and I felt I got more for my money than at the Greasy Spoon the day before.
