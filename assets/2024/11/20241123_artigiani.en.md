Tonight, I had dinner at Artigiani pizzeria, a restaurant I had spotted on the MTLàTABLE website. I arrived at 8:30 PM, my reservation time, and was seated at a small table right next to a large cabinet containing alcohol bottles. To my left, there was a table with 8 to 10 people seated. The restaurant was full, and the warm, dimmed lighting gave the place a cozy atmosphere.

For starters, I ordered the burrata, which was very good.

The Artigiani pizza was delicious. The soppressata was so crispy it almost tasted like bacon.

After the pizza, I was almost full. I still decided to have dessert, mostly out of greediness and to try something else from the restaurant. I chose the zeppola, and frankly, with all that ricotta, it was a bit too much after the pizza I had eaten. I should have chosen something a bit lighter.

Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner at Artigiani and I will definitely return. The service and food were impeccable.
