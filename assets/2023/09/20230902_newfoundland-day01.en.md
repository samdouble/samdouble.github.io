The flight was short, lasting just under two hours. As planned, upon exiting the airport, I took a taxi to pick up my rental Subaru Impreza in the north of St. John's. I thought I would pay little for the taxi, given that the airport is also in the north, but the driver told me that from the airport, it was always a fixed rate of $35[^1].

The Subaru owner left me the keys after taking photos of his car from all angles. I was a bit nervous about driving. It was an automatic car, but I had lost the habit, having lived in the city for the last few years. I installed my GPS on the dashboard and waited a bit for it to find its position.

I arrived at my AirBnB in Torbay, a small village 2-3 kilometers north of St. John's airport. It was a small house at the end of a cul-de-sac. In front of the house was the parking lot and immediately after, a trail that led down to Father Troy's Trail. The view towards Torbay Bay below was breathtaking. I chatted a bit with the hostess, a retiree who lived alone with her small dog and spent her time collecting old photos of the area.

On my hostess's suggestion, I left for the Post Taphouse, a restaurant on Torbay Rd. that opened in early summer. I took Father Troy's Trail southward, accessible from the small path in front of the house. The trail ran along a cliff overlooking Torbay Bay.

20 minutes later, I arrived at the restaurant. It was full, but they found me a spot on the terrace, with a view on the bay. I regretted not bringing a windbreaker, because with the sun starting to set, it was chilly.

I had the "Buttermilk Fried Chicken Tenders" with Caesar salad. The drinks were very good. If they hadn't been so expensive, I would have had more.

When I left the Post Taphouse, the sun had already begun to set. I didn't want to return to the AirBnB by walking along Torbay Rd., as it was a winding road with no sidewalk. I returned by the same trail I came from, hoping to make it back before all the light disappeared. In places, Father Troy's Trail was poorly cleared and you had to be careful not to catch your feet on roots.

It was quite dark when I arrived. I went to bed early and spent the next 2 and a half hours organizing the rest of the trip. It might have been my last chance to do so. Over the next 9 days, I was never going to stay more than 2 nights in the same place and I had to make the most of each stop. I started by booking dinner at Mallard Cottage, one of the best restaurants in St. John's, for the next day at 5 PM.
