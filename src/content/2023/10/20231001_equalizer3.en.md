Having greatly enjoyed Equalizer 1 and 2, I had been eagerly waiting for years to see Equalizer 3 in theaters. While I've seen about as many third films in a trilogy surprise as disappoint, I would say Equalizer 3 falls into the latter category. It's not a bad movie, but it's clearly the weakest of the three. If you're expecting to enjoy it as much as the other two, you might be disappointed.

Let's start with what I liked. Robert McCall has now left Boston to settle in a small village in Sicily. On a cinema screen, it makes for very beautiful images. Then, as in any good Equalizer film, we see Denzel Washington taking down scumbags in the most brutal way possible.

What I didn't like: the action scenes were short, few in number, and poorly distributed. I didn't feel the tension build up as in the first two films. In Equalizer 1, McCall crosses paths with Nikolai several times before the final confrontation. In Equalizer 2, when McCall realizes it's his former partner Dave who killed Susan, he goes to his house to confront him. A little later, they talk again on the phone when Dave and McCall's former friends enter his home to kill him. In Equalizer 3, these build-up scenes are non-existent. Yes, we see the mafia gang terrorizing the village several times, but each time, McCall only observes what's happening. Quite late in the film, he finally confronts Marco, the small-time boss, in the restaurant, but immediately after, he kills him in the alley. Not long after, he kills Vincent, Marco's older brother, whom we've barely seen before.

The scene where McCall surrenders to Vincent in the public square, putting down the two guns, is totally stupid. As if he believed that Vincent, after shooting him down like a dog in front of the whole village, would have left the village in peace. It's absurd and the Robert McCall of the first two films would never have done that.

The scenes with Collins, the CIA girl, are totally useless. In my opinion, this character could have been removed without any consequence to the film's story. Every time her investigation progresses, it's because McCall has already put the puzzle together and spoon-feeds her the answers. She then only relays the information to Frank, her sidekick. It's obvious to an extent that it becomes embarrassing. Lucky for her that McCall is a good guy, because he could easily have asked for half her salary.

— McCall to Collins: "If I were you, I'd ask myself: why Sicily? Why go through the most secure port in the region?"  
— Collins to Frank: "Why Sicily? Why go through the most secure port in the region?"  

...

— McCall to Collins: "It's not Syrian terrorists who did this, but the local mafia."  
— Collins to Frank: "We're on the wrong track. We need to stop looking for Syrian terrorists. It's the local mafia."  

It seems the movie producers only put Collins in it so that at the end, in the very last scene, the viewer can understand that she is actually the daughter of the late Susan and Brian, McCall's friends we saw in the first 2 films. But the payoff isn't worth it. It's a "plot twist" that, at best, will make you shrug.

In short, despite all this, I still enjoyed Equalizer 3. It was a decent, albeit disappointing end to a good trilogy. I give it 6.5/10.
