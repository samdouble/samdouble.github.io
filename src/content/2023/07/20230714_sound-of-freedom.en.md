I just went to see Sound of Freedom at the cinema. What a great film that was. Not only because of the significant message regarding child trafficking, but the action itself kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire 130 minutes.

When you read a bit about Sound of Freedom online and in newspapers, you'll quickly notice that critics describe it as a "christian" film, and some even go so far as to say it promotes conspiracy theories. The producers of the movie are Mormons, but I suppose it doesn't matter to the geniuses whose job is to comment on films.

But even then, throughout the entire film, I counted only three religious references, and they weren't at all necessary for understanding or appreciating the movie. The first is when Tim, the main character, quotes the Psalms just before apprehending a pedophile. The second is when he says, "God's Children are not for sale". Finally, the third is when Vampiro says something like, "God still has work for me on this Earth". That being said, if you consider the fight against child trafficking as something particularly religious, then yes, you'll probably think it's a christian film. Otherwise, Sound of Freedom is no more christian than 95% of the movies playing in theaters are woke (but aren't labeled as such in movie reviews).

Regarding the film promoting conspiracy theories, I didn't see anything like that, unless you think child trafficking is fiction. Really, how challenging is it to watch a film and objectively critique it when your job is to watch films and objectively critique them?

Anyway, Sound of Freedom is a movie worth seeing. If you're like me, you'll appreciate it as much as you would any good action thriller. 9/10.
