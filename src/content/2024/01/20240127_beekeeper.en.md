Your favorite film critic is back for another review. This time, it's The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham.

A good movie, if you know what you're getting into: a fairly classic revenge film where Jason Statham single-handedly dismantles a powerful organization of cyber-fraudsters. It's satisfyingly violent and you'll enjoy it as long as you don't expect an original and sophisticated storyline. I really liked the scene where Jason Statham terrorizes the depraved geeks in their call center. The film does a good job of portraying Danforth (the main antagonist) as a despicable hipster daddy's boy. The fact that he rides a skateboard inside an office was a nice touch.

At times, I felt like I was watching the first John Wick movie again. I don't mean to say that negatively; the first John Wick movie was great. The scene where Wallace explains to Danforth how much trouble he's in with a "beekeeper" on his tail, in particular, seemed heavily inspired by the scene where Viggo explains to his son how he messed up by killing John Wick's dog. There are plenty of other similarities between the plots of the two films.

I didn't like the character of Verona Parker, the FBI agent. I found her unnecessarily arrogant, and it seemed like she was only there because the film's producers wanted to keep the character in the story in some way after her mother's death at the beginning of the film. The scenes involving her felt forced and shoehorned in.

I give The Beekeeper a solid 6.5/10. 6 is too low for how entertaining it was, but 7 seems a bit too high for a very predictable story and somewhat cheesy dialogues.
