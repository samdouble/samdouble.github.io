Tonight, I went to try my 3rd MTLàTABLE restaurant of the year, June Buvette, in Pointe St-Charles. I crossed over the Wellington Street bridge, passing over the Lachine Canal.

June Buvette was located on Centre Street. I arrived at 6:00 PM, 30 minutes before my reservation.

It was quite busy. They seated me at the bar.

The service was quick. It helped being right at the bar, where I was directly in front of the server. As is customary with MTLàTABLE, all dishes had to be ordered at once, at the beginning. Once I got the first course, it didn't take long after finishing one plate to receive the next course.

The first dish was a beet salad with cheese. It was excellent and definitely my favorite course.

Then came the tuna tartare. This too was good, but it was small and gone in two bites.

The main course was the rigatoni dish. No issues with the taste, but I was disappointed by the portion size. After finishing it, it was clear that I would still be hungry after dessert.

I had never eaten a Paris-Brest before and like everything else I ate tonight, it was delicious.

In the end, I had a very good meal at June Buvette. The service was efficient, the food excellent, but I would have liked larger portions because I was left somewhat hungry.
