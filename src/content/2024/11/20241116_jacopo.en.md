For this last evening of MTLàTABLE, I decided to go to Jacopo in the Old Port. As of today, with over 600 reviews, it is ranked #5 out of 6,698 restaurants in Montréal on TripAdvisor, behind Café Olimpico in Old Montréal, Gaspar Brasserie Française, Le Petit Dep, and Maggie Oakes.

My reservation was at 8:30 PM, and since I was going to watch UFC 309 with several of my colleagues at the office afterward, some of them came to the restaurant too. During the afternoon, I made two changes to my reservation, and Jacopo's staff were accommodating over the phone.

In the restaurant, both floors were full. It was dark, and the tables were efficiently arranged, leaving little space to move around. We were upstairs at a small table for 4 people, but we had to wait until 9 PM to order because one person was late.

As an appetizer, the Jacopo caesar was very good and quite original with the "charcuterie chips."

By 10:15 PM, the second floor, which had been packed an hour earlier, was only half full, and we still hadn't received our main course. I had initially hoped to be back at the office by 10 PM, but it was clear now that we weren't close to leaving. It had been 45 minutes since we finished our appetizers, and I was starting to think the server had forgotten about us. That's when the main course arrived.

I had the pollo cacciatore, which was a chicken leg in a kind of risotto with vegetables. Not bad, but not incredible either, as the main course of a 3-course table d'hôte at $50. During the meal, we asked to have our desserts to go, so we wouldn't miss the last 3 fights of the evening.

The dessert, which I ate at the office, was the torta di mandorla, an almond cake in syrup with orange zest and salted caramel. I didn't take a photo because it was too dark in the office, but it was nice. You could really taste the orange and salted butter.

Overall, I had a good meal at Jacopo, but it was a bit too expensive for what it was. As for the service, I found it too slow compared to my other MTLàTABLE experiences. The wait seemed even longer because I had somewhere to go afterwards.
