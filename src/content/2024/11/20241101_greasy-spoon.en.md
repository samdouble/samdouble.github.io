It was the second day of MTLàTABLE today. This year, the prices are $35, $50, $65, and $80. For this Friday evening, I decided to go to Greasy Spoon ($50), on Laurier West, in the Mile-End.

I arrived at 6:20 PM and it was almost empty inside. The restaurant was long but not very wide. On the left in the center, there was a bar. Several TV screens were spread throughout the place and were showing what appeared to be a cooking competition on Food Network, with no sound. I sat at a small table.

For the appetizer, the fried brie salad was simple, with cubes of fried brie and cherry tomatoes. It was good, largely because of the brie cubes which, I believe, had been dipped in honey.

For the main course, I had seafood linguine. There were scallops, a few large shrimps, and calamari rings. When I received my plate, I thought I would probably be hungry leaving the restaurant, but that wasn't the case at all. It was well portioned. During my meal, several staff members asked if I was satisfied.

For dessert, it was a tiramisu, served in a cup.

Overall, I had a good meal at Greasy Spoon. I appreciated the service and the food.

The only negative point: the value for money, which was fine, but not great. I have the impression that I could go back to Greasy Spoon and eat the same thing for the same price without it being part of MTLàTABLE, which is a bit disappointing. This is an event created largely so that people are able to try restaurants at lower prices than during the rest of the year, and at $50 (+ tax + tip) for a salad, a pasta dish, and a tiramisu, I didn't leave feeling like I had gotten a "deal."
