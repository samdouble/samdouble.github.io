I went for dinner at Tiradito, a downtown Peruvian restaurant.

Inside, it had a bar atmosphere: dimly lit with music. The large logo illuminating the room in red created a nice ambiance, but I still preferred to sit in the calm of the terrace on Bleury Street.

It's a tapas restaurant with small plates to share. Overall, I enjoyed it. The chicha morada, a Peruvian drink, was very good. The taste reminded me a bit of grape Crush. It might sound reductive to say it like that, but grape Crush is delicious.

The pollo fritto was the first dish we received and to be honest, it was the highlight of the meal. It could be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten. Definitely, the bar was already set very high for the dishes that would follow.

The chicharron arrived and I found it to be a good mix of sweet, salty, and tangy with the mangoes and teriyaki sauce.

The duck tiradito was flavorful, but a bit expensive for the amount of food.

Apparently, there are more stars in the Universe than grains of sand on Earth. I don't know if that's true, but in any case, I'm pretty sure there were even more onions in my butifarra sandwich. I don't like onions and consequently, I was disappointed by their quantity in the last dish. When I finished putting them aside, the sandwich itself was good.

In short, it was a good meal and except for the onions in the butifarra sandwich, I liked everything. If I went back, though, it would be hard for me not to simply order three or four plates of the pollo fritto.
