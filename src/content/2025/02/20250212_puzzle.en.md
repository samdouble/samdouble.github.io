I loved Puzzle. It's a book I had picked up randomly at Archambault, just so I wouldn't leave empty-handed, but I was genuinely surprised by how much I got caught up in the story. It's like a cross between Ten Little Niggers and the movie The Game.

Ten Little Niggers, because it's a locked-room mystery (in an old psychiatric hospital lost in the middle of the French Alps) where 8 puzzle enthusiasts who mostly don't know each other die one after another and end up suspecting each other. The Game, because throughout the story, the line between what's real and what's part of the game is never quite clear. Are the players really dying, or are they actors paid by the game organizers to pose as contestants? After all, rule #1 of the game is that whatever happens, nothing they are going through is real.

When I was reading reviews on GoodReads, many readers said they had figured out the plot twist long before the end. That wasn't my case.  
In hindsight, there were indeed some clues that could have made the conclusion obvious, but personally, I didn't see it coming. The author did a good job of keeping all options open and juggling with different possibilities until the very end.

Puzzle was the first novel by Franck Thilliez that I read, and now I want to read more. The bar will be high for the next one.
