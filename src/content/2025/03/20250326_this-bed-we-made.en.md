I bought This Bed We Made on Steam a few days before Christmas, but I only started playing it this month. It's a game developed by Lowbirth Games, a Montréal studio based in Mile-End.  
It reminded me a lot of L.A. Noire. Beyond the obvious similarities in gameplay, era, and music, it's the same type of game where the emphasis is on story and characters rather than graphics and action. In This Bed We Made, this is even more true, as you never have to drive cars or shoot guns. Everything takes place in the Clarington Hotel, where Sophie, the protagonist, meticulously searches through the rooms of guests on the 5th floor.

There's also this mechanic where you can make different choices that change how things unfold, particularly during dialogues with other characters. So far, I've only completed the game once, so I don't know how much these choices affect the story's progression. The plot is very well crafted and, like L.A. Noire, you discover many characters and subplots that seemingly aren't connected but end up being linked as you uncover more clues.

The game is short. After about 4 hours, Steam informed me I had already reached 45% completion. Sure enough, it took me 9-10 hours total to reach the end. However, during all that time, I was really drawn in by the story and atmosphere. It's a shame it wasn't longer and, given the multitude of underdeveloped side plots, I wonder if this wasn't also the team's ambition at the start of the project:

- Eugene's dismissal
- The breakup between Jacques and Wendy
- The relationship between Bernard and Linda
- The two colleagues Susan and Yvette
- The very important guest in room 602
- The "Another Bloody Valentine" article in the newspaper
- <Spoiler shownText="Spoiler">The photos of Sophie in "Mr. Spade's" room: did he really follow her, take photos, and turn his hotel room into a darkroom just because he was bored?</Spoiler>

The conclusion was disappointing. The one I got, anyway. It's true that I played very cautiously, not throwing away any clues and trying to avoid getting involved in the personal stories of other hotel employees as much as possible. As Sophie finishes visiting one of the rooms, <Spoiler shownText="a major event occurs">we discover Hector Cruz's body</Spoiler>. 20 minutes later, it was over. <Spoiler shownText="Spoiler">Paul Morgan/Mr. Spade, Marcela Cruz, and Anne Bercy are accused and punished for the murder. Depending on how the interrogation goes, I assume there's an alternative scenario where Sophie takes the blame</Spoiler>.

Another disappointment was the voices. While it's nice to hear references to real places like Outremont or Stanley Street, it's unfortunate that the French voices use European French accents. Perhaps the developers made this choice because the French accent reaches more people worldwide, but hearing "mec," "putain," and "flic" in downtown Montréal in 1957 took me out of the immersion, and was a missed opportunity to showcase our accent and expressions.

It's a very good game, and I'll probably play it again in a few months when the solutions to the puzzles are less fresh in my memory.
