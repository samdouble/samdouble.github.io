Running out of oxygen alone at 100 meters deep in freezing waters and total darkness. Last Breath is the most anxiety-inducing film I've seen in a long time. Apart from snakes and terrorists, there weren't many boxes left to check on the list of primal fears.

The film tells the true story of [Chris Lemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Breath_(2019_film)), a saturation diver who found himself alone with a 10-minute oxygen supply at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after a series of unfortunate events. With even more luck and the help of his teammates who refused to abandon him, he eventually survived after spending 29 minutes without oxygen.

Last Breath wasn't too long and kept me on the edge of my seat until the end. I liked the final sequences of the film, where we saw the real Chris Lemons following the incident. It's incredible that 3 weeks after nearly dying, he went back to the bottom of the sea to finish the job. A true pro!
