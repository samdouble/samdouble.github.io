This morning, I went to eat at Café Aragon with friends. It was quite busy, but luckily we only had to wait 15 minutes before a table became available.

Although the café's clientele was quite diverse, it seemed like the kind of place popular with CEGEP students. At the entrance, there was a small bulletin board with posters for shows that are, let's say, fashionable in 2025. The waitresses were tattooed pretty much everywhere except their faces: that would have been a bit much with the piercings.

The menu was original, but me, not that much. I chose "L'Anglaise", a plate of waffles with potatoes, fruit, and maple syrup. At $13.50, it was great value for money.

To drink, I had the Vermeil, a smoothie with apples, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cinnamon.

The service was decent and overall, it was a good breakfast.
