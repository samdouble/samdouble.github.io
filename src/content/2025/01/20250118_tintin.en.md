This afternoon I went to Arsenal Contemporary Art, near Georges-Vanier metro station, to see the exhibition "Tintin, the immersive adventure". It was in a warehouse right next to the Ardent Mills flour mill.

When I arrived in the immersive projection room, I was surprised to see how many people there were. There must have been about 50 people of all ages. Like at Oasis Immersion, it was a large room of approximately 1500 square meters (by eye) where images from Tintin's adventures were projected on all 4 walls and the floor. There were light effects, music, and sound effects, but no voices. The animations were minimal, consisting of lateral movements, slight rotations, and scaling.  
The images were all taken from the albums but weren't necessarily organized in the same chronology. Most often, the images would flow according to a specific theme. At one point, the music became dark, and suddenly all the antagonists from the series appeared: Rastapopoulos, Rascar Capac, Captain Allan... Then, for example, Captain Allan could serve as a transition to show all the sequences where Tintin was on a boat, etc...

Then, an excerpt from a Radio-Canada interview with Hergé from 1962 was shown. Times have certainly changed! He and the interviewer were outside on garden chairs, and he was calmly smoking his cigarette while answering questions.

Upon leaving the projection room, there was a small souvenir shop with collectible items selling for several hundred dollars. I think the $55 T-shirts were the cheapest thing I saw there.

The rest of the exhibition was set up like a small museum. There was a room with a wall filled with covers of all the albums in all languages.  
The scale isn't clear in the photo, but the covers are actual size. It was impressive.

In another room, whose center was occupied by a replica of Marlinspike Hall, the walls represented a timeline of Hergé's history. There were interesting anecdotes, for example, one about the creation of Jo, Zette and Jocko, a much less popular series than Tintin, which had been requested from Hergé by the management of Coeurs Vaillants newspaper because they wanted a better ambassador than Tintin, who had no family or job.

The last room was dedicated to space exploration. Pages from Explorers on the Moon were framed on the walls. There were explanations about the research Hergé had to do with scientists to give realism to the plots of Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon. These were also the first albums to be produced with the Hergé Studios team.

All in all, I stayed for 75 minutes, split equally between the immersive projection and everything that came after. It was very interesting and it was nice to see that there are still many Tintin fans.
