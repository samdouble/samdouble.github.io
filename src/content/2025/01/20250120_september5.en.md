Before going to see September 5 in theaters, I knew nothing about the Munich Olympics terrorist attacks in 1972. The IMDB synopsis was quite vague, and I think both of these factors meant that I didn't have the right expectations for this film.

It takes place in the ABC Sports offices in Munich, specially set up for Olympic Games coverage. In the early hours of September 5, terrorists from the Black September group infiltrate the Olympic village and take 9 members of the Israeli team hostage after killing 2 of them.

I was expecting a suspense film like [The Insider](https://www.imdb.com/fr/title/tt0454848/), where somehow the ABC producers would have been unwillingly drawn into negotiations with the terrorists. Instead, they are, like us, helpless spectators of the action captured by their cameras placed in the Olympic village. In fact, we never leave the ABC Sports studios throughout the entire film.  
Far from being a thriller, it's much more of a documentary that tells the story of the attacks from the perspective of sports journalists and shows their moral dilemma in covering the attack live, while the whole world is watching and this had never been done before.

Thinking I was going to see an action movie, I was disappointed, but once I understood that wasn't the intention, it was quite watchable. While I wasn't entertained as I had imagined, it educated me about a significant historical event.
