It's official, I'm going to the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco during the first week of June. I'm really looking forward to it.  
I had submitted presentation proposals last year, but Snowflake didn't select them. Both of my proposals this year were also rejected, but the company I work for is trying to increase its number of technical attendees compared to last year. So there will be nine of us going in total.

We will be staying at the [Hotel Adagio, Autograph Collection](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RWsr4Pr1iHTNm2jT8), near the [Moscone Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hegZ7BpFTKCS53uv9), where the Summit will take place.  
As for the flight, everyone is booking theirs separately. On my end, I'll be doing the Tour de l'île in Montréal on Sunday morning, and I don't trust myself to be able to wake up at 5AM the next day. So I'll be leaving on Sunday evening at 6:30PM. The Summit ends on Thursday. I'll take Friday to visit and return on Saturday. For the night from Friday to Saturday, I've booked a room at the [Chancellor Hotel on Union Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BRv8Bi85tHHUwqSk8).
