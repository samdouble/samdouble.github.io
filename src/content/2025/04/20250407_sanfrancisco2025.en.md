It's official, I'm going to the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco during the first week of June. I'm really looking forward to it.  
Like last year, my presentation proposals weren't selected by Snowflake, but the company I work for is trying to increase its number of "technical" participants. We'll be 9 people in total attending.

We'll be staying at the [Adagio Hotel, Autograph Collection](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RWsr4Pr1iHTNm2jT8), near the [Moscone Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hegZ7BpFTKCS53uv9), where the Summit will take place.  
For the flight, everyone books separately. On my end, I have the Tour de l'Ã®le in Montreal on Sunday morning and I don't want to have to wake up at 5 AM the next day. So I'll leave Sunday evening at 6:30 PM. The Summit ends on Thursday. I'll take Friday to visit and return on Saturday. For Friday night to Saturday, I've booked a room at the [Chancellor Hotel on Union Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BRv8Bi85tHHUwqSk8).
