Tonight, I had dinner at Virunga, near Parc Lafontaine. It had been on my to-do list for at least a year and, luckily, it's a Treater partner restaurant, so I could use the gift card I won at work for my Halloween costume.

It took me about thirty minutes to walk there. It was around -10Â°C, but at least there wasn't much wind. On the way, I passed by the nativity scene at Saint-Jean-Baptiste Church.

I arrived at 7 PM.

It's a tiny restaurant, with room for about 20 people. There were 5-6 other customers when I walked in. It was quite dark, and on each side of the room, there was an armchair and some African decorations on the walls. The music, mainly afrobeat with heavy auto-tune, was a bit too loud for my taste. The menu was sophisticated, showcased local products, and had only 3 to 4 choices per course, which is usually a good thing.

For the appetizer, I had the "mishkaki", a beef sirloin skewer. I waited nearly 45 minutes for this dish and was getting quite eager for it to arrive. However, the following courses came more quickly. The skewer was good, though a bit spicy. Then again, my spice tolerance has never been very high. During my last few bites, I had a slight hiccup that didn't last long.

For the main course, I had the "ngome kongwe", a smoked lamb steak. When it arrived, I was surprised by the small portion size, especially for a $46 dish. It was barely larger than the appetizer, but it was delicious! The lamb fell apart with just a fork and was perfectly salted. I wished there had been more.

For dessert, I had a banana compote with Tanzanian chocolate. It was nice and not too sweet.

The service was very good. My main criticism of this dinner at Virunga is the quantity/price ratio. At the end of the meal, I was still a bit hungry. Yet, with tip and taxes included, it cost me $85, and that's because my Treater gift card gave me a $30 pre-tip discount. Without it, I probably would have paid $120. That's very expensive, especially considering I only drank water.

I expect a $30-40 meal to fill me up, so $85-120...! If the prices had been lower, I would have given it 4.5/5 for food and service quality, but a 4 better represents my overall satisfaction.
