Violet is a single mother who has just started dating again. One evening, she leaves her 10-year old son with her sister to go on a first date with Henry, a man she's been chatting with for several weeks. They meet at The Palate, an upscale restaurant on the top floor of a high-rise building.
Everything goes well until Violet starts receiving "drops" - anonymous messages from someone within a 15-meter radius. The mysterious person quickly makes it clear to Violet that her son and sister are being held hostage at her home and will be killed unless she does everything she's told. The messages must be coming from somewhere in the restaurant, but between the man she's collided with twice, the bold pianist, the weird waiter, the man on the blind date, the bartender, and Henry, Violet has no shortage of suspects.

Drop kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Well, until about 10 minutes before the end. I found the action scenes that follow after Violet identifies the person sending the messages to be far-fetched. For everything else, I suspected everyone and couldn't figure out who might be behind the messages.  
This film strongly reminded me of Non-Stop, but with enough different or new elements not to be a copy. I really enjoyed it and, in my opinion, it deserves better than the 6.5 score showing on IMDB.
