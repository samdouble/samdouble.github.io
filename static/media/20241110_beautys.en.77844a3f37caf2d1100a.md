This morning, I woke up early to go to Beauty's for brunch. The restaurant opened at 8:00 AM, and since it's a well-known spot in Montr√©al, I figured it would fill up quickly. At 7:30 AM, I was on my way. There was hardly anyone on Park Avenue as the sun was beginning to rise.

I arrived 10 minutes before opening and was quite surprised to see there wasn't a line out front. For a moment, I doubted whether it was actually open, before pressing my nose against the door and seeing there were employees inside.

There were 5 of us who entered when Beauty's opened its doors at 8:00. I sat at a small table for two near the kitchen. The decor was very "old-time luncheonette" with the patterned floor, the booths, and the counter with leather stools.

There were many choices and the menu, with its Jewish inspiration, was unique, featuring items like Russian bread and blintzes. Wanting to try everything, I ordered the SuperBeauty's with coleslaw and orange juice. The SuperBeauty's consisted of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 slices of bacon, 1 bagel, and home fries. It was good, and the orange juice in particular was flavorful and seemed freshly squeezed.

As I was finishing the bagel, which was the last thing left on my plate, I heard one server tell another in English that they would need to free up "23" soon. I quickly figured out who 23 was when a minute later, they cleared my table and handed me my bill. In their defense, as much as the restaurant was near-empty at 8:00, it was already full by 8:30.

Finally, the service was decent, apart from feeling a bit rushed to pay and leave quickly. The meal was quality and I was full afterward, but next time, I think I'll try something less classic than eggs, pancakes, etc., because that's something I can find in pretty much any breakfast restaurant, probably for less money. If I come back to Beauty's, I would definitely try that Russian bread or those blintzes.
