This morning, I went to Caribou Gourmand for their Sugar Shack brunch. I had a reservation for 10:00 AM.

The restaurant had just opened, and I was one of the first customers. I was assigned a seat by the window.

The menu was divided into 3 sections, each with 3 to 4 options: sweet breakfasts, savory breakfasts, and the classic brunch. It was hard to choose; I wanted everything. Finally, I went for the Sugar Shack Platter. It seemed like the choice that would let me try a bit of everything. The plate included maple-braised ham, apple and maple sausage from Jean Talon Market, maple syrup bacon, baked beans, maple scrambled eggs, yak cretons from the Yakiti Yack farm in Bolton East, oreilles de crisse (deep-fried pork rinds), sweet pickles, toasted country bread, breakfast potatoes, and mesclun.

To drink, I had a red berry iced tea. Unfortunately, it wasn't sweetened. It was like in the U.S. when you order "iced tea" instead of "sweet tea". That was the only hiccup in the meal.

This was my third time at Caribou Gourmand, and it has always lived up to my expectations. It's a safe bet that knows how to showcase local and original products in generous portions.
