### 6:30 PM EDT
I arrived in the waiting area for boarding, which was scheduled for 8:15 PM.

For one reason or another, boarding was delayed by about an hour and a half. We were originally supposed to land in Vancouver at 11:00 PM (local time), but with this delay, we would be landing at 12:30 AM. I still hoped that I would have time to retrieve my luggage and take the Canada Line that connects Vancouver Airport to downtown.

As expected, once at Vancouver Airport, by the time I retrieved my suitcase from the carousel, it was already too late to take the Canada Line. I took a taxi that brought me to the Sandman Hotel, at the corner of W. Georgia St. and Cambie St. for $40. It wasn't the start I wanted for my travel budget, but at least I had reached my destination.

My room was on the 9th floor and the window overlooked the alleys between W. Georgia St. and Robson St. I went to bed a little before 2 AM.
