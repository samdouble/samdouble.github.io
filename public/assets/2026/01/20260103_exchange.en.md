#### Synopsis

Fifteen years after The Firm, Mitch McDeere is now a lawyer in New York at Scully & Pershing, the largest law firm in the world. He is asked to represent a Turkish engineering company that was never paid by the Libyan government for the construction of a one-billion-dollar bridge in the middle of the desert. He travels to Libya to see the bridge, accompanied by Giovanna, a rising star at Scully & Pershing and the daughter of his close friend Luca, who does not have much time left to live.

The night before the trip into the desert, Mitch suffers from food poisoning that prevents him from going to see the bridge. Giovanna has to take his place. This worries Mitch, but he eventually agrees since Giovanna will not be alone. She will have, among others, four bodyguards at her side. The expedition does not go as planned, and Giovanna is kidnapped. In the days that follow, the perpetrators release videos showing the four bodyguards and the two other companions being brutally murdered with chainsaws.

Who is behind all this? The Gaddafi government? An extremist group? And for what purpose? The mystery lingers until Abby, Mitch’s wife, is approached in a café in New York by Noura, a mysterious veiled woman, who hands her a phone and tells her to remain available 24/7 to answer it. This is how the kidnappers demand a ransom of 100 million dollars for Giovanna, to be raised within ten days. Mitch must race around the globe to find this absurd amount of money and hope to save his friend’s daughter.

#### Review

Like The Broker, another John Grisham novel I read recently, I found this one to be very linear. While reading, it feels like a lot is happening: Mitch has to travel to a remote island in Maine where he has sent his two sons to keep them safe, then goes to Italy to speak with Luca, then returns to New York to meet the top executives at Scully & Pershing, just before leaving for London to speak with someone else in the British government, then goes back to Italy, and so on. You can really feel how exhausting those ten days are for Mitch, constantly traveling across three continents to try to convince diplomats from various countries, the Turkish company, and his own firm to contribute to the ransom.  
However, once the book is finished, you realize that it’s a lot of build-up for not much payoff. From the moment Noura gives Abby the phone, the story essentially becomes Mitch traveling to multiple countries to raise the 100 million dollars, while trying to negotiate an extension of the deadline through Abby. The lack of twists makes this second half of the novel feel long. Aside from the question “Will Mitch manage to raise the money and save Giovanna?” (which is fairly predictable), there is little that really makes you want to stay engaged.

The story also leaves several questions unanswered, which is unfortunate, because answers to these questions would have made it more interesting.  
Who is responsible? A brief chapter suggests that Giovanna was kidnapped by the gang of Adheem Barakat. But Barakat is barely mentioned anywhere else in the remaining 400 pages of the novel. All we learn about him is that he is the leader of one of the many terrorist groups roaming the Libyan desert near the border with Chad.  
Are there traitors in Mitch’s camp? At one point, Abby suggests to Cory Gallant, head of security at Scully & Pershing, that his team may include traitors who are providing information to the terrorists. Interesting! Who? How? Why? There is no point in hoping for more details.

In short, The Exchange wasn’t bad (it actually started out quite well), but I wouldn’t read it a second time.
