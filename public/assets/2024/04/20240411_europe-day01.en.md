### 5:15 PM EDT
I left for the airport directly from work, as I had taken all my luggage with me in the morning. I was able to reach my boarding gate in 30 minutes.

It was advantageous to check in quickly last night: it allowed me to get the last free window seat, 42A. It was at the very back of the plane, in the third or fourth row from the end, but it could help me have a good night's sleep.

### 7:00 PM EDT
Boarding took place on schedule. It was the first time I had taken a plane (an A350-900) with two aisles and rows of nine seats.
