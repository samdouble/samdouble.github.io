François Donge is a businessman who lives with his wife Eugénie (Bébé) and their son Jacques. On the surface, everything seems to be going well in his life, until the day Bébé poisons his coffee with arsenic. He survives and, while Bébé is arrested by the police for attempted murder, François reflects on what could have gone wrong by remembering key moments of their marriage.

I didn't really like this novel, compared to the other ones I've read by Georges Simenon. It wasn't bad, but at the same time, apart from François Donge who gradually realizes that he was a bad husband, not much happened. The failed poisoning occurs in the first quarter of the book and afterwards, it's simply Donge reviewing his marriage, his honeymoon, how he drove Bébé's friend out of his house, etc... He comes to blame himself for the hatred Bébé feels towards him and at the end of the story, after the trial, he regrets that his wife must be punished for what she did, because in a way, she is the victim of the life he made her endure.
