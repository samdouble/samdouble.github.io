### 4:15 AM EST
I woke up at 4:15 AM and by 5:00 AM, I was on my way to catch the 747 bus that would take me to the airport. It was quite early, given that the flight wasn't until 9:40 AM, but with all the regulations surrounding Covid-19, I wanted to give myself a good margin of error in case of any problems.

The night before, on my way back from work, I had gone to Jean Coutu to take a test valid for 24 hours. I had also filled in all the necessary information for my trip in the United Airlines Travel Ready app.

At 6:00 AM, the bus dropped me off at the airport.

After nearly 75 minutes, I had passed through security checks, which is longer than usual, but it still left me with 2 hours of waiting before boarding.

### 11:15 AM EST
The flight to Newark (EWR) went well. I felt like we were already descending as soon as the ascent was over.

At the airport, I ate a New York-Style Pastrami Reuben at the Garden State Diner.

### 2:15 PM EST
A few hours later, I took my flight to New Orleans. This one was longer than the first, almost 4 hours.

### 5:00 PM CST
Upon arrival at my destination, I looked for a way to get to my hostel in downtown. It's something I should have planned beforehand, but after inquiring, I was advised to take the E2 Airport Drive bus, which would drop me off near Canal St.

When I exited the airport, the sky was uniformly gray and it was hot. To further convince me that I was no longer in Montréal, there were palm trees everywhere.

I took the bus, which brought me a few blocks from the HI New Orleans Hostel on Canal St. Across the street was the Saenger Theatre, a theater that opened just before the Great Depression.

I checked in at the HI New Orleans Hostel to drop off my suitcase. It was my first hostel experience and I must say it was much nicer, cleaner, and more modern than I had imagined. The floors were hardwood and the rooms were named after different neighborhoods in New Orleans. Mine was called "Marigny". Actually, when I say "mine", it's a figure of speech, because there were 7 other people staying in it.

Entering the room, it was dark, even though it wasn't even 7 PM yet. I didn't want to turn on the light in case someone was sleeping. The heavy door made a loud CLACK as it closed behind me. My bed was the top bunk in the far right corner. Each bed had a locker and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were large enough to accommodate my big suitcase and backpack. It was a relief: I could enjoy my trip with peace of mind, not having to leave my things unattended in the room.

### 7:00 PM CST
I had a full day behind me, but I still wanted to make the most of it and be able to say that I had done more on my first day of vacation than just travel.

I walked through the French Quarter, always staying on busy and well-lit streets, as recommended by all the travel guides I had read. There was a lot of animation and music coming from every street corner. I eventually reached Jackson Square, but didn't linger, knowing I would have other opportunities to come back during the day.

I went to the very popular Café du Monde to get some beignets. There was a mass of people, but it moved quickly. There were several lines, not quite well indicated, and each led to a small window behind which employees were just taking already prepared beignets, putting them in a bag, and adding a ton of powdered sugar.

For $2.50, I got 3. It was good, but my last meal was a long time ago and I needed more. I went back to the French Quarter and stopped at Pier 424 Seafood Market on Bourbon St. I had to wait a bit to get in, but it was less bad than at other restaurants. Given that it was my first meal in "The Big Easy", the "Taste of New Orleans" was almost mandatory. I was able to taste some classics of the region:

- Cajun chicken & andouille jambalaya
- Crawfish étouffée
- Red beans and rice
- Chicken and andouille gumbo

### 9:30 PM CST
After dinner, I returned to the hostel. I would have liked to take some time to organize my next day, but I was too tired.
