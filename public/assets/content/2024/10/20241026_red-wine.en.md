Today at a party, without paying attention, I backed into a table where a glass of wine was sitting and got it all over the back of my right leg, just below the knee. Since my chino pants were beige, it left a large stain about 3 cm wide by 20 cm "high". I went to the bathroom to rub some water on it, but it didn't do much.

Two hours later, when I got home, I searched online for ways to clean a wine stain, knowing full well that time wasn't on my side. As recommended in an article, I poured baking soda to cover the stain and left it like that overnight. The next morning, I removed the baking soda, rinsed with water, and the stain was still there, clearly visible.

In the evening, I tried a second method. In a large bowl, I poured white vinegar and soaked the leg of my pants in it, making sure the entire stain was submerged. The next morning, using paper towels, I vigorously rubbed the stain under water. It was already much better, but there still seemed to be a slight pale pink coloration.

When I came back from work in the evening, it was dry and you could barely tell which leg had been stained with wine.
