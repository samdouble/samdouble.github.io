Tonight, I wanted to try a restaurant in Chinatown. Looking at Google reviews, I targeted Pho Bac on St-Laurent Boulevard and Chez Chili on Clark Street. I entered Pho Bac and, as I walked towards the table I was assigned, I increasingly noticed a musty smell. The server placed menus on the table before going to do something else. Just as I was about to take off my coat to sit down, I preferred to leave immediately. This smell, although not horribly overwhelming, was killing my appetite.

So I headed to Chez Chili, at 1050b Clark Street. When I saw "1050" on the storefront, I went in and climbed the stairs leading to the restaurant. The dining room was square and spacious with a dozen tables placed throughout. It seemed even larger since only one table was occupied.

On the left side when entering, the windows overlooked Clark Street. The restaurant was well decorated. All along the wall, there were 3 rows of empty Tsingtao bottles, a popular Chinese beer.

As an appetizer, the miso soup was good and just salty enough. It contained pieces of tofu and seaweed leaves. The seaweed leaves made it difficult to drink the soup neatly.

The crispy avocados, which sat in a plum sauce, were nice. It was surprising because it didn't taste like what I thought it would.

The beef rice burger, as a main course, was disappointing. The Singles cheese slice sticking out was the first hint that I wouldn't like it. The piece of beef in my first bite was lukewarm. It was a bit better in the middle of the burger, but it should have been hot. The rice patty was crispy, that was fine, but there was something I didn't love about this mix of crispy rice patty, semi-warm beef, Singles ~~cheese~~, and whatever that sauce was.

Towards the end of the meal, I noticed a large "Coin de Fuji" logo on the wall at the other end of the dining room. That's when I realized I might not be at Chez Chili, as I thought, but in a restaurant called Coin de Fuji. When leaving the restaurant, the same "Coin de Fuji" logo was on the entrance door. I walked down Clark Street and, just a bit further down, at the intersection with de la Gauchetière Street, there was indeed Chez Chili, at 1050b. I went to the wrong restaurant! In my defense, Chez Chili's entrance was on de la Gauchetière Street, not on Clark.

Afterward, I checked the Google reviews for Fuji Corner, expecting something mediocre, but on the contrary, it had an average rating of 4.5/5 with just under 100 reviews. According to its Facebook and Instagram pages, it seemed the restaurant had opened its doors just under a year ago.

Maybe I was just unlucky. Several years ago, I changed my opinion about the Lockhart bar after going there a second time, and there's no reason why it couldn't be the same for Fuji Corner. Eventually, I'll give it a second chance.
