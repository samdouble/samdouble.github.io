George is an MI6 agent known for his infallible ability to detect lies. He is given the mission to investigate 5 of his colleagues: one of them is a traitor, and George has one week to discover who it is. The problem is that his wife, who also works for the agency, is on the list of suspects.

Black Bag's plot is well-crafted, and it was surprisingly engaging for a film with little action. It's primarily a spy movie, and what makes it interesting are all the little schemes, manipulations, and strategies: what one person knows, thinks they know, thinks another person knows, does knowing what others know, etc... There was a lot of dialogue, but also several plot twists, which meant it was never boring.

The ending was hard to predict. I really enjoyed it, and at 1 hour and 33 minutes, it was just the right duration.
