### 3:45 AM EDT
I woke up and had some cereal. At 4:10, I went out and stopped by the convenience store to get change for the bus. It was lightly raining, but not enough to make waiting outside unpleasant.

### 4:55 AM EDT
I arrived at the airport. There weren't many people. At 5:20, I was at the gate.

While waiting, I looked for activity and restaurant ideas, how to get to Manhattan from Newark Airport, how to get to the hostel from Penn Station, etc...  
I wanted to see a Yankees game. Luckily, they were playing at home all weekend against the Tampa Bay Rays, but the Saturday and Sunday games were in the afternoon. Tickets on TicketMaster for that evening were expensive: minimum 72 USD for seats far in the outfield. However, on StubHub, I managed to find a seat in section 321, near first base, for a total of $60 (CAD).

For Saturday, I bought a ticket to The Vessel. I wanted to see a music or comedy show in the evening, but I gave up on that idea since I had to get up early on Sunday morning.

In summary, my weekend planning was done.

At 7:20, we were informed that the flight would be delayed by an hour due to heavy air traffic.  
An hour later, an additional 45-minute delay was announced.

### 9:30 AM EDT
Finally, we were able to board the plane. Without the delays, we would have landed in Newark in 15 minutes. Now, the expected arrival was at 11:30.

The flight went well. At noon, I arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport.  
I took the AirTrain to get from terminal B to the train station. It was a small shuttle with 5 cars, each accommodating 10 to 12 people, on elevated tracks a few meters in the air.

<p align="center"><b>At Newark Airport (EWR)</b></p>

Then, I took the train to Penn Station. New York Penn Station, to be more precise. Yes, because there was also a stop called "Newark Penn Station" on the way to New York Penn Station. I almost got off there, but the guy sitting across from me, seeing my hesitation, explained that there are 2 "Penn Stations": one in Manhattan and one in New Jersey. Very confusing.

### 1:15 PM EDT
I arrived at Penn Station. I went outside through Madison Square Garden, at the corner of 8th Avenue and W 33rd St. It was nice and warm. There were people, cars, and skyscrapers all around.

<p align="center"><b>At the exit of Penn Station</b></p>

My first objective was to find Center415, on 5th Avenue between 37th St. and 38th St., to pick up my things for the bike tour. I walked east along W 33rd St. and W 34th St., mainly.

### 1:50 PM EDT
I was hungry. It was almost 2 PM and I hadn't eaten anything since my bowl of cereal at 4 AM. I walked to Joe's Pizza, a place that had been recommended to me, at the corner of Broadway and W 40th St. When I got close, there was a long line, to the point where I saw the line before the restaurant. I didn't feel like waiting, so I looked for another restaurant.

A few streets away, there was the [Capizzi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9g9sHwbBeKpcXuNT8), at the corner of 9th Avenue and W 40th St.

<p align="center"><b>Looking for a place to eat</b></p>

I went in. Inside, it wasn't very big. There were about 10 small tables for 1 to 4 people. It was empty, except for the waitress, who was sitting and working on something at the back table. There were sheets of paper in front of her.

She got up and took care of me. She was very pretty.  
I ordered a Loaded Pizza without onions (mozzarella, provolone, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and roasted garlic). It was delicious; the crust had just the right firmness.

For dessert, I had a cannoli. It was bigger than I thought. I left feeling very full.

### 3:00 PM EDT
I walked down 9th Avenue to the NHL Shop, which was two blocks west of Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, where I had arrived earlier. This would be my last stop before checking in at the hostel and leaving my big bag there.

The NHL Shop was smaller than I recalled, when I went there more than 15 years ago. I was disappointed they didn't have much Toronto Maple Leafs merchandise. The store was on two floors and, unsurprisingly, mostly featured team-colored clothing (caps, t-shirts, jackets, ...). TVs were showing the previous night's game between the Wild and the Golden Knights.

At 34th St-Penn Station, I took the 1 train to the hostel in Manhattan Valley.  
The subway felt very industrial. It was the complete opposite of the subway in Japan, for example, with pastel-colored ads and delicate chime sounds indicating an announcement was about to be made.
The stations had ceramic tile walls and were lit with harsh white light. The cars weren't painted. They were metal gray with an American flag sticker on each one.
The subway arrived at the station with a deafening CLANG CLANG. Inside, it was like the Montr√©al metro, but older and dirtier. As we approached stations, the radio quality was so poor it was impossible to understand what the operator was saying. I had to look through the window at the station name on the walls to know where we were. When I couldn't see, I finally figured out a trick: calculate about 7 streets per station (34th, 42nd, 50th, 59th, 66th, 72nd, 79th, etc...).

### 4:20 PM EDT
I got off at 103rd St. The [HI New York City Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RuV1EH3r5KsMBYnQ8) was a block away, on Amsterdam Avenue.

<p align="center"><b>In Manhattan Valley, near 103rd St. station</b></p>

The inside of the hostel was very different from the HI Hostel in New Orleans, where I stayed 3 years earlier. The one in New York, obviously less modern, felt like it had been an old boarding school or an old psychiatric hospital. The floors were made of small patterned tiles. My footsteps were echoing in the long dark corridors.

My room was on the 4th floor. This time, I was in a room with 4 beds. Mine was the bottom one when entering the room. I put my big bag in the locker and left with just my small bag (without my computer).

### 5:15 PM EDT
I walked on Amsterdam Avenue toward 116th St. hoping to walk around the Columbia University campus before going to the baseball game.

At 112th St., I passed by the [Cathedral of St. John the Divine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vooSwqTJH88kGgTV6). At 116th St., I arrived at the university's gate. Unfortunately, it's a private institution and people at the entrance were checking student IDs.

I turned back via Frederick Douglass Boulevard. At 110th St., there was a large roundabout marking the northwest end of Central Park. I continued walking on the boulevard, which was now called Central Park W. The park was much lower, and every few streets, there were stairs leading down to it.

I didn't have enough time to visit Central Park before the game. I took the subway at 110th St.

### 6:10 PM EDT
I arrived at Yankee Stadium (161st St.). Outside, it was chaos. There were fans everywhere and police cars blocking the streets. Street vendors were posted all around selling Yankees caps and jerseys.

<p align="center"><b>At Yankee Stadium</b></p>

To get to section 321, there were escalators, but then, you had to walk on an asphalt path like those in parking garages.
My seat was even better than I had anticipated. I was directly on the axis between third and first base and high enough to see the game well. 2-3 balls were hit in my direction, but our section was too high to have a chance of catching them. You could see the ball approaching, then disappearing below.

It was a good game. The Yankees scored the only 3 points of the game in the 6th inning.

As the spectators were leaving, the song "New York, New York" was playing on loop in the stadium. It stayed in my head throughout the whole trip.

### 9:45 PM EDT
I took the D line to return to the hostel. What I hadn't noticed was that it was the express version of the line. The subway stopped at 125th St. Normally, 103rd St. would have been the third station from there. I started to understand something was wrong when we passed straight through 110th St., which I had taken a few hours prior.

It was also incredibly hot and humid in the subway. It was packed with thousands of Yankees fans who were talking, laughing, and celebrating their team's victory. After a while, the conversations started to focus less on the game and more on how stifling the atmosphere was in the car. I was sweating profusely and watching the stations go by, wondering which one we would finally stop at.

Finally, the doors opened at 59th St., almost 70 streets further. When getting off, you could see 2 large rats on the opposite platform.
I took the 1 line in the opposite direction.

### 10:45 PM EDT
This time, the subway stopped at 103rd St.
