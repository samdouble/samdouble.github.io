I went back to Caribou Gourmand before they took the Sugar Shack brunch off the menu.

This time, I had the Cajun crispy chicken waffle.

The avocado pur√©e on the waffle gave a nice flavor with the sweetness of the waffle and the saltiness of the chicken.  
I still preferred the Sugar Shack platter I had a few weeks earlier, because it stood out more from what I could find elsewhere and did a better job of showcasing a variety of local products.
