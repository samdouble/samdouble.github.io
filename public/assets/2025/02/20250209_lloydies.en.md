This afternoon, I went to Montréal Boréal, a winter festival in St-Henri. It only spread across a few streets and the entertainment was mainly for children. Then again, on a Sunday at 2 PM, that's not surprising. I had a hot chocolate in the big inflatable igloo and some maple taffy sticks, but I didn't stay long.

I wanted to eat tacos at the festival, but the stand was closed. So I went to Lloydie's, a Caribbean restaurant on Notre-Dame Street.
Inside, the style was intentionally retro with leather booths, patterned tables, and mosaic tile flooring.

I ordered the fried chicken plate and a spicy beef patty. It was a good meal and I could barely finish it. Along with the chicken leg, there was rice and large pieces of plantain.

The warmth of the meal felt good after being outside in the cold. The food was good, not phenomenal, but for a total of $20, it was an excellent value for money.
