### 0:45 AM EST
I woke up at 0:45 AM. My alarm was going to ring 30 minutes later anyway, so I figured there was no point in going back to sleep.

I ate some leftover yogurt with strawberries, got dressed, and at 1:25 AM, I left home to wait for bus 356. Usually, I take the 747 to get to the airport, but the 356 passes closer to my place. I had never taken this bus before, and I still haven't. Neither the 1:32 AM nor the 1:55 AM bus showed up.

Since the forecast temperature in Japan during my stay was 10-14°C, I didn't bring my winter coat. Instead, I wore a hoodie with a rain jacket over it. At 2 AM, with a wind chill of -15°C, needless to say I was starting to freeze and had lost faith that the next 356 would come. I hopped into a taxi that passed by.

The ride cost me $55, but I arrived at the airport at 2:30 AM. It was almost empty. There were a few employees here and there and people sleeping on benches.

In the U.S. departures area, there were two couples in their fifties waiting for security to open its doors. I lined up behind them. Security didn't open until 3:30 AM, but it was worth arriving early because by then, the line had grown long behind me. Being the fifth person of the day to go through security made the experience much more relaxed than usual: no people running around and no rush to retrieve your things from the bins.

After security, there was another wait: the one for the U.S. Customs, which didn't open until 4:30 AM. Since I was among the first people in the line, I was able to reach the boarding gate by 4:45 AM.

### 6:00 AM EST
We took off at 6:00 AM as planned.  
The flight lasted 2.5 hours, and I slept through almost all of it. I fell asleep just as we were leaving the ground. Later, I woke up for 5 minutes to realize we were above the clouds, then fell back asleep. When I finally woke up, we were already below the clouds, minutes away from landing.

### 8:00 AM CST
At Chicago O'Hare, I went looking for a place to eat.  
I got a choriqueso tortilla at Tortas Frontera. Apparently, in 2023, this restaurant was in the Top 5 highest-rated airport restaurants in the United States on [Yelp](https://blog.yelp.com/community/best-airport-food-on-the-heels-of-holiday-travel/). Indeed, it was good, but I should have thought to ask for no onions.

I had 5 hours to wait at the airport, so I walked around, but pretty quickly settled down somewhere to plan my first days in Tokyo.

### 1:45 PM CST
We took off 30 minutes late due to a de-icing operation.  
The flight was scheduled to last over 13 hours, which is double the longest flight I had taken until then. Fortunately, I had made sure to get a window seat (49L), so I was able to sleep here and there. The rest of the time, I watched movies and played around with FlightPath 3D, the app that lets you see how the flight is progressing.

I initially (and naively) thought we would fly over the Midwest and follow a line roughly parallel to the equator to Japan, but instead, from Chicago, we immediately headed northwest, crossing western Ontario, Manitoba, and northern Saskatchewan to fly over the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Alaska. Then, from Alaska, we went back south along the coast of Russia through the Bering Sea to reach Japan.

Above Fond-du-Lac, Saskatchewan, just as we were approaching the border with the Northwest Territories, something strange happened. Suddenly, within the span of a minute, everything outside took on a purplish tint.

Then, it kept getting darker with this strange tint as we continued northward.
