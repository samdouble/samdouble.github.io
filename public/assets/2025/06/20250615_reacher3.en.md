For the third season of the Reacher series, I was eager to see if the writers would return to something closer to the excellent first season or continue along the same lines as the very average second season.  
The beginning of the first episode seriously made me doubt. When Reacher impulsively shot a police officer and then nervously fled in a van with the young man he had just saved from a kidnapping, I thought I had my answer.  
Actually, no. I’ll spoil it, since it’s revealed later in the same episode, but the kidnapping and the “dead” police officer were staged. Reacher, helped by the DEA, uses this fake kidnapping attempt to infiltrate the business of a wealthy local rug dealer, Zachary Beck, who is also the father of the young man.

Following the event, Zachary Beck feels indebted to Reacher, but also believes he is responsible for the murder of a police officer. He invites him to stay in his mansion to escape the search. In return, he entrusts Reacher with the mission of watching over his son Richard.  
Reacher takes advantage of his stay with the Becks to secretly inform the DEA about the activities of Bizarre Bazaar, which is clearly more than just a rug company. However, what really interests him is the possible involvement of Xavier Quinn in Beck’s affairs. Quinn is a former lieutenant colonel in the army who used to sell state secrets and who brutally killed Dominique Kohl, Reacher’s protégé, when she got too close to his activities. By some miracle, he supposedly survived the bullet Reacher put in his head years earlier.

I’m very happy with this season. The plot was well put together and there was just the right amount of Neagley, whom I found far too present in season 2. The character of Reacher has returned to what he was in the first season, that is, independent and not very talkative. The dynamic between Reacher, Duffy, and Villanueva was similar to what he had with Roscoe and Finlay.  
I’m looking forward to season 4. It shouldn’t be ready anytime soon, but that will give me time to catch up on the books.
