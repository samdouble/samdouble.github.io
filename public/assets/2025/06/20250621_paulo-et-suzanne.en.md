On my way to the Bois-de-Liesse Nature Park, I stopped at Paulo & Suzanne restaurant on Gouin Boulevard. This nearly 50-year-old spot is an institution in Cartierville.

Upon entering, there was a counter to place your order immediately to the left. In front, a TV displayed the different choices of hot dogs, hamburgers, poutines, etc. At the back of the restaurant, there was a small dining area with stools and leather booths.

I had a Michigan hot dog without onions and a Québec hot dog. The prices were very reasonable. It came to $13.50 for both hot dogs and fountain iced tea. However, you had to pay cash.

I ate outside, on the small terrace by Gouin Boulevard. Both hot dogs were excellent, but what stood out to me was the meat sauce on the Michigan hot dog. Yum!

I'll definitely be back, in the context of another bike ride in Cartierville.
