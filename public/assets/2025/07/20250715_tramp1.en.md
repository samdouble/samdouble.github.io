The first cycle of Tramp is a 4-album series telling the story of Yann Calec, a young ship captain hired to be the victim of a barratry. His boss, Julien de Trichère, has just bought an old ship that he plans to have torpedoed at sea to collect a million dollars from insurance. With the help of de Trichère's secretary, Calec is made aware that something is up, but doesn't know what or when. When he finally discovers the truth, he cannot reveal what he knows because there are traitors among his crew members, most notably René Floss, his first mate.

The drawings are generally well done, though sometimes rough, especially when it comes to faces. Throughout the 4 albums, Calec didn't look the same. In the first volumes, his face is long with a pointed chin, almost like a manga character, while towards the end, he has a squarer jaw with a light stubble. I didn't recognize him immediately.

It's a fun read with a good plot.
