F1 is a very good movie to see at the cinema. I regret not having seen it in IMAX, because the shots on the race track would have been worth it.

The story, although set in the universe of F1, is quite classic at its core. Ruben Cervantes is the boss of APX GP, a struggling team that has been at the bottom of the rankings for several years. The team absolutely must win at least one race before the end of the season, otherwise the shareholders will force Ruben to sell. Desperate, Ruben turns to his friend Sonny Hayes, a prodigy driver whose full potential was never realized due to an accident 30 years earlier, to save his team.  
Nothing is going right at APX GP: the car is underperforming, the mechanics are inefficient, and Joshua Pearce, their #1 driver, although promised to a bright future, is young and arrogant. Things don’t get better when Sonny joins the team. His reckless driving style doesn’t please everyone, and Pearce, in particular, doesn’t appreciate having to fight the old Sonny for the number one driver spot. Will the APX GP team be able to turn things around and give Ruben his first victory before the end of the season?

So, pretty classic, but it’s gripping from the start. I didn’t see the time go by.
