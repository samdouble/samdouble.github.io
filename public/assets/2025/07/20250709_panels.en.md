I finally proceeded with the migration to .NET 8, since [.NET 7 is obsolete](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) and has been for over a year now. I had already tried last September, but `dotnet-releaser` did not yet support .NET 8 at that moment. This time, it only took a few minutes and everything works as before.

Same thing for the migration from iText 8 to iText 9. None of the breaking changes between the two versions applied to Panels. It was very different from last year's migration from iTextSharp (iText 5) to iText 7, which had forced me to rewrite a large part of the logic that displays images on the PDFs.
